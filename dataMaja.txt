Knowing the power and limitations of topic modeling is of high importance for many text
mining technologies, as it has many applications both in dimension reduction and natural
language processing. This report will present an example of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) topic modeling applied to descriptions of states taken from the English wikipedia and
combined with k-means clustering. The wikipedia entries of states are always structured in a
similar way and cover topics like the statesâ€™ history, geography, politics, economy,
demographics and culture. For this project, a LDA topic model with Gibbs sampling was
trained on the wikipedia entries of 93 Asian and European states. The purpose was to find out
whether there would be a correlation between the topics which occur in the descriptions of
certain countries and their geographical and developmental similarities. Thus, the states that
have been put in one cluster are compared in respect to geographical measures like their
distance and to their human development indices (HDI). This project shows that topic
modeling techniques are able to represent such similarities partly. However, several methods
to improve the approach described in this report were found.
